Bistable Element
    - has 2 states - Q is 0 or 1
    - The simplest sequential circuits to remeber something need memory to remember history

D flip-flop, positive edge triggered
   - D flip flop stores input D at the trigger, the rising edge of C
   - to store a bit in D flip-flop: set up D, and then make C transit from 0 to 1
   - The saved bit does not change until antoher value is stored

Register with Write Control   
   - The register is updated with D on clock edge only when write control input is 1
      - otherwise - keep original value in register
      - WRite also called Enable

State Machine
   - A kind of sequential circuit updates registers synchronously withthe same clock
   - Bits in a registers indicate states 
      - state is a summary of previous inputs

   - The state is stable within a cycle
   - The state machine does two things
      -Generate the output
      - decide the new state for the next cycle

What is Happening in a cycle
   - Between clock edges:
      - New state is stored in state elements
      - Combination logic computes
      - state for next cycle is presented at the input of the state elements
   - clock cycle must be long enough to complete the work 

Clock Rate
   - sum of delays 
      - sum of tprop and tcombinational

Memory 
   - Read
      - set address and MemRead to 1 and wait
      - Get the data from Read data
   - Write 
      - Set address, Write data, and MemWrite to 1 and wait

   - MemWrite and MemRead should not be 1 at the same time
