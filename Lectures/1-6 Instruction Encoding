RISC-V Instruction Encoding

Representing Industrictions with Bits
    - 32 bits are used to encode instructions


RISV-V instruction words
    - Program Counter (PC) points to current instruction
        - incrememted by 4 in normal flow for sequential execution


RISC-V R-type Instructions
    - for instructions that have 3 registers as operands

    funct7 | rs2 | rs1 | funct3 | rd | opcode

    - fields in type R-type
        - opcode: 7-bit operation code
        - rd: destination register number
        - rs1: first source register number
        - rs2: second source register number
        - funct3: additional function code
        - funct7: even more function code


I-type Instructions
    - same like R-type, except that funct7 and rs2 merge
    - fields in i-type
        - opcode - 7 bits
        - rd - 5 bits
        -rs1 - 5 bits
        -funct3 - 3 bits
        -imm [11:0] 12 bits

    Loads i-type
        - lw    x1, 32(x2)
                rd, imm(rs1)


Stores S-type
    imm[11:5] | rs2 | rs1 | funct3 | imm[4:0] | opcode
    
    sw  rs2, offset(rs1)  # imm is offset

    -fields in S-type
        - opcode
        - rs1: first source register number
        - rs2: second source register number
        - imm[11:5] and imm[4:0]:
            The lower 12 bits of immediate are stored into two fields
            Bits 11 to 5 are in funct7 and bits 4 to 0 are in rd
