Computer Abstractions and Technology - Intro to RISC-V

Register File
    - Faster but holds less
    - The register file in RISC-V has 32 registers
        - Registers are numebred from 0 to 31 (x0, x1,....)
        - Each register has 32 bits = a 32 bit data item is called a "word"
    - We use registers to keep frequently accessed data - registers are fast

    - 1 byte = 8 bits

Arithmetic Operations: Add and Subtract
    - add  x3, x1, x2  #x3 = x1 + x2
    - sub  x3, x1, x2  #x3 = x1 - x2
           rd  rs1 rs2

    - Many operations have the form above
        - Three operands and all are registers
        - The left most register is the destination register rd where result is saved
        - Two source registers are reffered as rs1 and rs2

    addi rd, rs1, imm # rd = rs1 + imm
