Multiplication instructions
    - # lower 32 bits of the product
        mul     rd, rs1, rs2

        mul only stores lower 32 bits - register only has 32 bits of space

    - # higher 32 bits depend on signs of rs1 and rs2
        mulh    rd, rs1, rs2    # both are signed
        mulhu   rd, rs1, rs2    # both are unsigned
        mulhsu  rd, rs1, rs2    # rs1 is signed, rs2 is unsigned


Division Instructions
    - # signed
        div     rd, rs1, rds2   # rs1 / rs2
        rem     rd, rs1, rs2    # rs1 % rs2

    - # unsigned
        divu    rd, rs1, rs2    
        remu    rd, rs1, rs2


    - no divide by 0 checking
